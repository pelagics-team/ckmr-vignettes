    "text": "Half-sibling pairs\nSo far we have considered direct marks only, whereby a juvenile “marks” its parent upon being born and for the parent mark to be recaptured we have to sample both the juvenile and its marked parent (i.e., POPs). Let’s now move on to the `indirect’ marks, the half-sibling pairs (HSPs). Here, the parent mark is recaptured when we have sampled two (or more) of its offspring over different cohorts. In the process, we found out a few things about the parent from the characteristics of its offspring (even though we’ve never actually seen the parent!). First, the parent was mature when the oldest of the sibling was born and second, the parent was still alive when the youngest of the sibling was born. For fish-like species, we also know that the parent contributed more to the total reproductive output the year that the youngest of the sibling was born (since it grew in size and thus, increased its fecundity).\nLet’s look at the number of possible combinations between potential half-sibling pairs. First, note that we’re not accounting for adults in HSPs comparison to avoid including grand-parents. So we’re only considering samples that are possibly juveniles (i.e. 7 years old or younger).\nFor half-siblings, we are only interested in the year they were born (i.e. the cohort they belong to). The dataset has a similar format to that for POPs, that is two columns that index the record in samp_notog1$Samps. Of note the pairs are ordered (by convention) to list the youngest of the sibling first, the oldest second. Comparisons should only be made in one direction (to avoid double-counting) so we pick oldest to youngest and retain it (including in likelihood calculations).\n\nhead(samp_notog1$HSPs)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,] 1138 1688\n[2,] 1158 2630\n[3,] 1175 2076\n[4,] 1782 2923\n[5,] 1268 1897\n[6,] 1419 2364\n\n\nWe can look at the detected HSPs by combination of birth years and compare that to the number of possible pairwise combinations between different birth years (see env$n_comp_HSP).\n\n\nCode\nbbdf <- with(samp_notog1, data.frame(B1=Samps$B[HSPs[,1]],\n                                     B2=Samps$B[HSPs[,2]]))\nbbdfag <- bbdf %>% group_by(B1, B2) %>% tally # count by combinations of birth year\n\nhxl <- range(filter(samp_notog1$Samps, poss_off)$B) + c(-0.5, 0.5)\n\nhc1 <- ggplot(bbdfag, aes(B1, B2, fill=n)) + geom_tile(show.legend=FALSE) +\n    geom_text(aes(label=n), size=2.5) +\n    scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(sequential_hcl(40, 'Emrld'))) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept=seq(hxl[1], hxl[2]), colour='grey', size=0.25) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept=seq(hxl[1], hxl[2]), colour='grey', size=0.25) +    \n    annotate('text', x=-Inf, y=Inf, label=paste('n =', nrow(bbdf)), vjust=1.2, hjust=-0.5) +\n    xlab('') +\n    ylab('Birth year of older sibling\\n') + xlim(hxl) + ylim(hxl) +\n\n    ggtitle('Detected HSPs')\n\nhspdf <- samp_notog1$Samps %>% filter(poss_off) %>%\n    group_by(B) %>% tally\n## create df with all possible pairwise combinations of birthyears,\n## filter to only keep combinations where B2 > B1 (note '>'---no same cohort comparisons)\nhspcomp <- expand(hspdf %>% group_by(B, n),\n                  rename(hspdf, B2=B, n2=n) %>% group_by(B2, n2)) %>% filter(B2 > B)\n\nhspcomp$Num <- with(hspcomp, n * n2) # number of pairwise comparisons\n\nhc2 <- ggplot(hspcomp, aes(B, B2, fill=Num)) + \n geom_tile(show.legend=FALSE, colour='grey') +\n    geom_text(aes(label=n), size=2.5) +\n    scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(sequential_hcl(40, 'Emrld'))) +\n    xlab('\\nBirth year of younger sibling') +\n    ylab('') + xlim(hxl) + ylim(hxl) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept=seq(hxl[1], hxl[2]), colour='grey', size=0.25) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept=seq(hxl[1], hxl[2]), colour='grey', size=0.25) +\n    ggtitle('# of valid comparisons')\n\nhc1 + hc2 + theme(axis.title.x=element_text(hjust=-0.85)) + plot_layout(nrow=1)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s also useful to look at the age difference between the detected half-siblings, as that tells us something about adult survival (and will indeed inform the population model with regards to \\(M\\)):\n\n\nCode\nbbdf$diff <- with(bbdf, B2 - B1)\n\nggplot(bbdf, aes(diff)) + geom_histogram() +\n    xlab('\\nAge difference') +\n    ylab('Count\\n')\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## compare that to the possible age difference given all the pairwise comparisons\n# hspcomp$diff <- with(hspcomp, B2 - B1)\n# table(with(hspcomp, rep(diff, Num)))\n\n\nSo, most HSPs we detected are separated by one to three years, with a few that go up to 6 years. We’re also learning about parent age, e.g. the parent for the HSPs separated by 6 years was at least 11 years old when they produced the youngest offspring (given age-at-maturity)."

    "text": "The likelihood for half-sibling pairs\nComputing the probability of observing a half-sibling pair is a bit more complicated, so it’s been broken down into a few steps.\nStep 1: Cumulative survival—what is the probability that an adult of age A who was the parent of a sibling born in year B1 survived to year B2 to become the parent of the second sibling.\nThat number is simply the ratio of the abundance of adults of age A in year B1 to the abundance of adults of age A + (B2 - B1) in year B2, since the adults will be B2 - B1 years older:\n\n\nCode\npsurv_ayy <- autoloop( a1=ADAGES, y1=Bju_range, y2=Bju_range, {\n    \n      dy <- y2-y1 # Age difference between cohorts\n      a2 <- a1 + abs(dy) # Adult's age when second cohort was born:\n      a2_clip <- pmin(a2, AMAX) # making sure we don't allow Adults > AMAX\n      # (in case adults would have add to be older than AMAX)\n\n      ans <- (dy >= 0) *      # forwards only (i.e. y2 > y1 to avoid double-counting)\n          (a2 <= AMAX) *      # plus-group dies entirely\n          (N_ya[ y2, a2_clip] / N_ya[ y1, a1]) # the probability of survival\n    return(ans)\n    })\n\n\nSince we don’t know the age of the parent (we haven’t sampled it—it’s an indirect mark), we need to compute the probability across all possible parent ages (i.e. 5 to 12) for a given sibling pair.\nStep 2: Get the contribution to TRO of the parent of unknown age in year B1 and in year B2.\nFor convenience, we start by computing the expected contribution to TRO of each adult cohort of age a for each juvenile birth year y:\n\nPr_Mum1Age <- autoloop( y=Bju_range, a=ADAGES, {\n    return( N_ya[ y, a] * fecata[ a] / TRO[ y])\n    })\n\nStep 3:\nWe combine all the previously computed quantities to estimate the joint probability that an adult of a given age A was the parent of an offspring born in year B1 and an offspring born in year B2. For this we account for the parent’s contribution to TRO in B1, the probability of surviving to B2, and the parent’s contribution to TRO in B2, i.e. the product of: - the proportion of adults of age A surviving from B1 to B2 - the contribution of the parent of age A + B2 - B1 to TRO in year B2 - the abundance of parents of age A in B1 scaled by their contribution to TRO in that year (computed in Step 2):\n\n  Pr_HSP_and_Mum1Age <- autoloop( B1=Bju_range, B2=Bju_range, PARAGE=ADAGES, {\n      \n      # Given on adult (mum)'s age at B1 (ie PARAGE)\n      # Probability that adult of age A survived from B1 to B2 *\n      # Contribution to TRO in B2 of adults of age PARAGE in B2\n      Pr_HSP_cond <- (B1 < B2) * psurv_ayy[ PARAGE, B1, B2] * fec_fn( PARAGE+B2-B1) / TRO[ B2]\n\n    return( Pr_HSP_cond * Pr_Mum1Age[ B1, PARAGE]) # * contribution to TRO in B1 of adult *cohort* of age PARAGE\n\n  })\n\nTo get the probability that two HSPs are related across all possible parent ages at B1 we just Pr_HSP_and_Mum1Age over all parent ages:\n\n  Pr_HSP <- sumover( Pr_HSP_and_Mum1Age, 'PARAGE')\n\nPr_HSP is the probability of a half-sibling pairs for all combinations of B1 and B2 over all possible parent ages at B1.\nNow, we just need to adjust these to account for the proportion of false negative detection for half-siblings, Pr_FNeg_HSP (in this example it’s set to 0 but typically could be 15%).\n\n  Pr_HSP <- Pr_HSP * (1-Pr_FNeg_HSP) # allow for known loss-rate due to kinference\n\nAnd now, we can compile the joint likelihoods for the expected probability of POPs and HSPs given our observations:\n\n lglk <- sum( dpois( n_POP, lambda=n_comp_POP*Pr_POP, log=TRUE)) +\n     sum( dpois( n_HSP, lambda=n_comp_HSP*Pr_HSP, log=TRUE))"
